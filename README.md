## Models to Predict Severity of a Traffic Accident (STA) based on Road and Weather Conditions
Applied Data Science Final Project

## Introduction
## Business Problem
Traffic accidents are, in modern times, a great cause of health issues for many developed and under-develop countries with the latest one having the higher rates in the world and usually producing high number of deaths[1,2] and/or Property Damage.

Many papers have been published during the last years predicting traffic accidents severity, however, most of them come from datasets from developed countries. Available information from countries in development, in particular from Latin America, is limited, incomplete or segmented [3] where weather  or road conditions are not taken into account[4] being other factors considered as more important[4].

This work pretends to create Supervised Machine Learning Classification Models from Vehicle Collision Dataset from the City of Seattle as an example and initial starting point to show the importance of Weather and Road Conditions to estimate the STA in other regions.

The dataset to be used contains a Labeled attribute, Severity, describing the severity of an accident such as Injuries, Deaths involved and Property Damage. It also contains attributes such as number of people involved, type of vehicles, date and time, weather, road and light conditions for an approximate number of 200,000 records that need to be cleaned and prepared for the models.

K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines will be used as classification algorithms to create the models. An effort to balance the dataset will be done.

Evaluation methods such as Jaccard Index and F1-Score will be used to assess the models.
